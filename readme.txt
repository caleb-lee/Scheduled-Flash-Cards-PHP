Scheduled Flash Cards
by Caleb Lee

This is a basic flash card system that schedules when the user should be looking at flash
cards for maximum efficiency. The user adds the cards (by inputting text to a "front" and
a "back"), and then the program will show the cards to the user as needed to make sure
the user remembers nearly all the inputted information.

This application requires the use of a database. Database information can be inputted into
the constants at the top of 'model/DatabaseCommunicator.php'. Provided the information
there is correct and the program has proper read/write/update permissions to the database,
no other setup is needed.

Note that the intervals used in this system currently are simply guesses and not (yet) 
based on real science.
